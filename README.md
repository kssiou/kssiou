<h3 align="left">Offensive Security Engineer</h3>

Offensive Security Engineer with professional experience in **penetration testing**, **Active Directory security assessments**, and **enterprise authentication infrastructures**.

My work focuses on identifying **realistic attack paths**, exploiting **misconfigurations**, and evaluating the security posture of **complex enterprise environments**, with a strong understanding of how PKI and identity systems are abused in real-world scenarios.

I approach security from an **attacker’s perspective**, while maintaining a clear understanding of defensive constraints and enterprise risk.
